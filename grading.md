## David Ring (16/20P)

### 1. Perspective Transformation (4.5/5P)
* usage of command line parameters inconsistent
* any not-cloclwise selection does not work (-0.5)


### 2. AR Game (8.5/10P)
* cite your sources for the assets! If this happens again (this is already the second time), we will have to grade it as plagiarism. (-1)
* a bit hard to play since the hand/finger is not displayed (-0.5)


### 3. AR Game - now 3D (3/5P)
* additional second 3d model is missing (-1)
* laser beams come out of the entons' back instead of from the front, 3d-models could have been rotated (-1)
* performance is okay
